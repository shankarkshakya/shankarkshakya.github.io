My Ph.D dissertation work at OSU has focused primarily on oomycete pathogen *Phytophthora*. This includes population genetics analyses of *P. infestans* at its center of origin using microsatellite markers to using whole genomes to understand the evolution of effector genes in clade 1c species of genus *Phytophthora*.


## 1. **Analysis of *P. infestans* population from Mexico using microsatellite markers**

Microsatellites or simple sequence repreats (SSR) is probably the mostly widely used marker in any population genetic analyses however this is changing as the cost of sequencing has down. We performed analyses to describe the gradient in diversity as we move away from the center of diversity.

This work has already been published and can be found [here](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PDIS-11-17-1801-RE?mobileUi=0).


## 2. **Potential center of origin of *Phytophthora cinnamomi***

*P. cinnamomi* is a globally distributed, broad host range, soil borne oomycete pathogen. The center of origin of the pathogen is still a debate. We aim at using genome wide SNP data to analyse the global population of *P. cinnamomi* to infer its potential center of origin. Our analyses demonstrates presence of two distinct clonal lineages of A2 mating types and rare occurence of A1 mating type except in Asia. Isolates from Taiwan and Vietanam showed increased diversity compare to other geopgraphic regions.
