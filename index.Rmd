# **Little about me**

I was born and raised in Nepal.I got my undergraduate degree in plant pathology from Tribhuwan University of Nepal in 2010. Follwing my graduation, I started teaching in a small college in Nepal. In 2012, I was awarded a fellowship from [University of Florida](https://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/) (Go Gators) and [International Potato Center](https://cipotato.org/) (CIP) to pursue a masters degree in the field of plant pathology. After comletion of my M.S degree, I moved to [Oregon State University](https://bpp.oregonstate.edu/) (Go Beavs) to pursue my Ph.D in plant pathology with focus on population genetics, genomics and bioinformatics.

Currently, I am a Ph.D candidate in the department of botany and plant pathology.
